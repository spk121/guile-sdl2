Guile-sdl2 provides Guile Scheme bindings for the SDL2 C shared
library.  The bindings are written in pure Scheme by using Guile's
foreign function interface.

* Requirements

  Guile-sdl2 currently depends on the following packages:

  - GNU Guile >= 2.0.9
  - SDL2 >= 2.0.0
  - GNU Make
  - GNU pkg-config

  When building from a Git checkout, the following additional packages
  are required:

  - GNU Autoconf
  - GNU Automake

* Installing

  Guile-sdl2 uses the standard GNU build system, so installation
  requires the usual incantations:

  # ./configure
  # make
  # make install

  When building from a Git checkout, the following spell is necessary
  before running the above commands:

  # ./bootstrap

  GNU Guix users may install the current development snapshot
  described in =guix.scm= with the following command:

  # guix package -f guix.scm

* Developing

  To build the source code from a Git checkout, run the following:

  # ./bootstrap
  # ./configure
  # make

  To start a Guile REPL with a pre-configured load path for using
  guile-sdl2, use the =pre-inst-env= script:

  # ./pre-inst-env guile

  GNU Guix users may create a development environment with all of the
  necessary dependencies by running the following command:

  # guix environment -l guix.scm

* Contact

  Bug reports and patches may be sent to <davet@gnu.org>.

  The maintainer of this library hangs out in the #guile channel on
  irc.freenode.net, so help and general discussion may also be found
  there.
